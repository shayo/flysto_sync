# flysto Sync
This is a small utility that enables automated upload of log files from Garmin G3X to FlySto website.
Requirements:
* Toshiba FlashAir (not manufactured anymore, but you can find many of them on Ebay)
* Raspberry Pi (I went with pi zero 2, which has plenty of power to run this script).
* Micro-sd card
